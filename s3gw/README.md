# [s3gw][s3gw-url]

s3gw is an S3-compatible service focused on deployments in a Kubernetes
environment backed by any PVC, including Longhorn. Since its inception, the
primary focus has been on cloud native deployments. However, the s3gw can be
deployed in a myriad of scenarios, provided some form of storage is attached.

s3gw is based on Ceph’s RADOSGW (RGW) but runs as a stand–alone service without
the RADOS cluster and relies on a storage backend still under heavy development
by the storage team at SUSE. A web-based UI for management and an object
explorer are also part of s3gw.

## Quickstart

To install s3gw using Helm add the chart to your Helm repository and then run
`helm install`:

```bash
helm repo add s3gw https://charts.s3gw.tech
helm \
  --namespace s3gw-system \
  install s3gw \
  s3gw/s3gw \
  --create-namespace \
  -f /path/to/your/custom/values.yaml
```

## Rancher

Installing s3gw via the Rancher App Catalog is made easy, the steps are as
follows:

- Cluster -> Projects/Namespaces - create the `s3gw` namespace.
- Apps -> Repositories -> Create `s3gw` using the s3gw-charts Git URL
  <https://charts.s3gw.tech/> and the `main` branch.
- Apps -> Charts -> Install `Traefik`.
- Apps -> Charts -> Install `s3gw`. Select the `s3gw` namespace previously
  created. A `pvc` for `s3gw` will be created automatically during installation.

## Develop and test charts on the local machine

We have defined a set of common tasks frequently used during the
development and the testing process of the s3gw's charts.

### Requirements

- make
- Python 3, pip
- Docker, Docker compose
- Helm
- k3d
- Kubectl
- [ct][ct-url]

### Setup the test environment

It creates a Python venv and downloads the required pip packages used
during the charts testing.

```shell
make setup-test-environment
```

### Start a k3d cluster and deploy charts

This task spawns a k3d cluster and deploys the local charts version on it.

```shell
make cluster-start
```

### Delete the k3d cluster

It deletes the cluster created with `make cluster-start`.

```shell
make cluster-delete
```

### Lint and unittest the charts

It lints and runs the all the unittest using the ct tool.
This task requires you previously created the k3d cluster with
`make cluster-start`

```shell
make lint-test-all
```
